## Introduction
This project utilizes the power of the ResNet50 model to significantly advance the accuracy and efficiency of image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. More details can be found in [slide 3 of the presentation](/path/to/presentation.pdf).

## Dataset Description
The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 color images spread across ten distinct classes. For more information, refer to [slide 4 of the presentation](/path/to/presentation.pdf) or visit [Kaggle CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/data).

## Implementation
Detailed steps on how the dataset was imported, preprocessed, and used to train the models can be found from [slides 5 to 7 of the presentation](/path/to/presentation.pdf).

## Model Comparison
Performance metrics and validation for each model are detailed in the presentation, with an epoch-wise performance overview and test results summarized in [slide 15](/path/to/presentation.pdf).

## Challenges and Considerations
The project outlines specific challenges encountered during implementation, such as GPU constraints and training limitations. Refer to [slide 16 of the presentation](/path/to/presentation.pdf) for a detailed discussion.

## Conclusion
The project's key accomplishments, insights, and future directions are presented in [slide 17 of the presentation](/path/to/presentation.pdf).
